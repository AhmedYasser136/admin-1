    What are the minimum permission needed for:

    Copy a directory (permission for source directory and permissions for target parent directory) source directory: execute and read permission target directory: execute and write permission.

    Copy a file (permission for source file and and permission for target parent directory) source file: read permission. target file: dosn't need any permission since it doesn't exit before you copy it, or write permission if the file exists

    Delete a file To delete a file requires both write (to modify the directory itself) and execute (to stat() the file's inode) on a directory

    Change to a directory write & execute

    List a directory content (ls command) read

    View a file content (more/cat command) read

    Modify a file content wirte, read & execute
